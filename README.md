I created disney plus web app aparience using react.<br>
<br>
**It will display movies and series and you will be able to search them with a client- side router structure , this will be the following**<br>
domain/ : start page<br>
domain/home: initial page of disney plus<br>
domain/search: searched by name or genre<br>
domain/movies: all movies will be here<br>
domain/series: all shows will be here<br>
<br>
<br>
**need to have**<br>
<br>
<br>
*all routes<br>
<br>
<br>
*user will be able to navigate the page by clicking movies or categories in the nav bar<br>
<br>
*the content in my homepage components would be links to its main containers (/movies or /series)<br>
<br>
**nice to have**<br>
<br>
*movies will take you to a dynamic end point where you will be able to see the youtube trailer without going to youtube page.
