# disneyPlus App

Mock of Disney pluslayout

Here i want to present my first attempt to clone disneyplus app using react.js

**DEMO**

I created disney plus web app aparience using react.

**It will display movies and series and you will be able to search them with a client- side router structure , this will be the following**
domain/ : start page
domain/home: initial page of disney plus
domain/search: searched by name or genre
domain/movies: all movies will be here
domain/series: all shows will be here
**need to have**
*all routes
*user will be able to navigate the page by clicking movies or categories in the nav bar
*the content in my homepage components would be links to its main containers (/movies or /series)
**nice to have**
*movies will take you to a dynamic end point where you will be able to see the youtube trailer without going to youtube page
